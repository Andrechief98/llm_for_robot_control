# Experimental Results and Metrics
This repository provides the analysis scripts and extracted numerical results for the three experimental setups described in the associated research article. Each experiment is organized in a dedicated folder under the `Results/` directory.

## Requirements
The scripts were developed and tested under the following environments according to the experiment considered:
- Python scripts: Python 3.10; 
- Matlab scripts: tested with MATLAB 2024b;
- ROS2 Humble (Oracle VM VirtualBox with Ubuntu 22.04);

```

### Low Level Control
This experiment evaluates LLMs-generated low-level control commands in a Turtlesim simulation using ROS 2 Humble.
- Results File: `results.json`
- Main Script: `low_level_control.py`
The python script allows to evaluate the performance of considered LLMs by executing the models generated low level control commands within a Turtlesim simulation using ROS 2. 

Before running the script, make sure you have a running instance of the Turtlesim node in ROS 2 Humble. You can launch the simulation with the following commands:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

To check the turtlesim position during the experiment, open a new terminal and launch:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose
```

Once the simulation is running, the script:
1. Parses the `results.json` file to extract the command sequences generated by each model.
2. Sends the commands to the Turtlesim node in simulation.
3. Extracts the inference time for each model's output.
4. Computes the mean and standard deviation of the inference times for each model.



### Complex Path Planning
This experiment evaluates the models' ability to generate complex geometric trajectories (lemniscates) subject to different geometrical contraints. 
- Results File: `results.json`
- Main Script: `plot_lemniscate.py`

When the script is executed, it:
1. Parses the JSON responses to extract the trajectory points for each model.
2. Plots each lemniscate path individually for visual inspection.
3. Extracts the associated inference times from the JSON file.
4. Computes the mean and standard deviation of inference times for each model.



### Obstacle avoidance
This folder contains MATLAB scripts for evaluating the performance of different models in robotic navigation tasks involving both static and dynamic obstacles. The experiments are organized into two main subdirectories:

#### static_obstacles
This folder contains tools for analyzing experiments involving static obstacles:
- `plot_metrics_static.m`: Processes ROS bag files and computes evaluation metrics;
- `check_collision.m`: Auxiliary function to detect collisions with obstacles;

#### dynamic_obstacles
This folder includes tools for analyzing experiments with dynamic obstacles:
- `plot_metrics_dynamic.m`: Analyzes ROS bag files and computes metrics for dynamic scenarios;

#### Data Access
Due to the large size of the ROS bag files, they are not included in this repository.
You can download the data from the following [link](https://mega.nz/file/KkpmUCrK#wHv4bGbS0QiFjCoqTTttRDzW7goj1bHcK8omS7W4x9M).

After downloading the files, organize the data into the folder `3.obstacle_avoidance` as shown below:

```bash
3.obstacle_avoidance
