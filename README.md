# Experimental Results and Metrics

This repository contains the numerical results and analysis scripts for three different experiments. Each experiment explores distinct aspects of the system under evaluation, and includes relevant data and scripts for metric computation and visualization.

## Repository Structure


## How to use it
### Low Level Control
The python script "low_level_control.py" allows to evaluate the performance of considered LLMs by executing the commands generated within a Turtlesim simulation using ROS 2. The LLM responses are stored in the `results.json` file.

Before running the script, make sure you have a running instance of the Turtlesim node in ROS 2. You can launch the simulation with the following commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

Once the simulation is running, the script:

1. Parses the results.json file to extract the command sequences generated by each model.

2. Sends the commands to the Turtlesim node in simulation.

3. Extracts the inference time for each model's output.

4. Computes the mean and standard deviation of the inference times for each model.

### Complex Path Planning
Results are store in the result.json file.

### Obstacle avoidance




## Requirements


## TODO:
- update the README.file with correct structure of the folders
- bag files stored on the external drive
